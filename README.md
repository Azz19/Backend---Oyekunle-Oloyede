The One Line a Day project backend.

One Line a Day platform provides an insightful snapshot of your thoughts, memories, change, and progress on each of the 365 days of the year. Gives users a single location to record and retrieve their thoughts.

Users can log in and start making entries in their 10 year journal. They can create, review, update, and delete data. The app functions as a journal and you can see all entries each day across 10 years at the same time.
